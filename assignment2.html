        <h3>PLASTIC POLLUTIONS</h3>
        <p class="box"><Font-size="5"><br>According to this <a href="https://www.iucn.org/news/marine-and-polar/201906/swedish-crown-princess-visits-viet-nam-country-struggling-plastic-pollution"target="_blank">article</a> from UICN in 2019, 
          Vietnam is one of the top five countries with mismanaged waste ending up in the ocean 
          and the country is struggling to combat plasic pollution. Ho Chi Minh is the largest city in Vietnam 
          and the river is the city's main water supply but yet it is heavily polluted with plastic waste nearby 
          and the level of microplastics in Saigon River has been found to be one thousand times more than rivers 
          in Europe. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Plastic pollution has become a global problem threatening the environment, health and economies, 
          the problem will only get worse if actions are not taken seriously. IUCN is working closely with 
          governments, industries and society across Asia and Africa to reduce and control plastic pollution.

          <br>
          The question seems to arise how did all these plastic waste ends up in the ocean anyway.
          Well as stated in this <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/geography/10-countries-producing-the-most-plastic-waste.html"target="_blank">article</a>, WorldAtlas has made brought some questions about recycling. 
          The system most people would assume plastic waste in the blue bin would go somewhere that would 
          be disposed responsibly or repurpose, but unfortunately 9 percent are recycled out of the hundred millions 
          plastics produced. The world produces and disposes plastic far too quickly than the recycling system can handle. 
          Ultimately when plastics can't be recycled and the consuming countries does not want to deal with the waste, it would be shipped elsewhere. 
          It is often exported out to the less wealthy countries for a fee, so temporarily it removes the problem from the consuming country but not the world's environment.
          Which is why the less wealthy countries like Vietnam would struggle to deal with both overseas and domestic polluted waste.
